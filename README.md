# Electricity Bill Calculator - PHP - 2021

## Overview

It is an honor for every developer to create a software that can asist users in their daily life. Therefore, I had created an Electricity Bill Calculator application with the reference of project that been created by trtshen and shabnum99 in **Github**. This application is used to calculate the monthly consumption of kilowatt-hours (kWh) used that need to be paid by the consumers. The tariff block (kWh) that was being used in this application is based on the general rate such as the rate that is being used by Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) company.  

There are a lot of programming languages that a developer can use, however, this application is more focuses on **PHP**. Therefore, I had use **PHP**, **HTML**, **CSS** and **Bootstrap**in developing this application.  

First and foremost, I had created `index.php` file, which is the default entry point for any web application. All of Electricity Bill Calculator instructions had been built in this file. **PHP** had been use to format the webpages as it is a powerful tool for making a dynamic and interactive webpages. 

However, **PHP** is quite limited in designing department. Hence, I had use **CSS** which is the **Cascading Style Sheets** to add specific fonts, colours, and a few elements that can make the website looks more visual dynamic.

Besides, I also use "Bootstrap" in designing the tariff block table. 

There are a few challenges that I entitle during developing this application and the one that I would like to focus is on generating a responsive website by using **Bootstrap**.       

## Learning Objectives

* Build and style interactive and dynamic webpages with semantic PHP, HTML and CSS
* Implement best practices when structuring PHP files by using elements, comments, breaks, and many more
* Execute specific calculation for calculating the consumer's electricity bill for that month by using the tariff block rate.
* Implement CSS Styling through class, id, and elements to design the webpages
* Implement Bootstrap to styling the tariff block table

## Functionality

* Input: Current (kWh) month meter reading, Previous (kWh) month meter reading
* Output: Total electricity bill excluded ICPT and service tax per month

## Tools Used
